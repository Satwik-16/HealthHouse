       <h1>Health is wealth</h1>
      <p>Everyone of us will want to have a healthy and hearty lifestyle. And yes, it is a must. Every person must have a basic knowledge about our body health and its functioning. Health just doesnâ€™t mean not having any complications but it actually means our mental and physical conditions to be perfect.
      <br>
      We live a busy life with our new normal, masking and social distancing. It has not been easy this year both mentally and physically. Our body definitely demands some attention. Yes! This maintenance game really becomes easy if one can respect and provide those needs to the body.
      Firstly, we humans are blessed with a body which has self healing powers. Therefore, it is oneâ€™s responsibility to give everything that our body might need.
      </p> <br>
      Letâ€™s now see the 7 needs of our body which not only help in body functioning but also promotes a healthy lifestyle: <br> <br>

1] Good air: Breathing is an automatic mechanism. But because of few unhealthy habits like obesity and smoking, they are taking only 70-80% of air in.
<br> <br>
2] Clean water: clean water is must. Even though we are getting it, we wont drink enough water daily. We must drink enough water that is required by the body. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that an adequate daily fluid intake is: About 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men. About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women.
<br> <br>
3] Proper diet: We eat food that we like. But we are not eating food that our body needs.
<br> <br>
4] Exercise: Because of the new normal and busy life schedule many of us are working from home sitting at a place without proper exercise. But we must do minimum exercise daily for our health and body.â€¨
<br> <br>
5] Excretion: This has also become a trouble for many people because of imbalance lifestyle and diet.
<br> <br>
6] Rest: we must get enough rest to meet the body needs.
<br> <br>
7] Positivity: Just like we humans, animals too have a body. They too need all the above to maintain good health. But, because of their lack of discretion they would only need the above 6. Positivity is something that only a human would require. Because, mental health of a person is as important as physical health. Therefore, one must inculcate positive mindset and do things. This would not only help you to maintain good mental health but will also help you to over come many health problems such as BP, heart attack, hyper tension, insomnia etc. Meditation and Yoga would be your best friends to deal with this.
<br> <br>
Therefore, it is our responsibility to provide all these 7 needs to our body which would make miracles with your lifestyle. All the Best ðŸ˜Š
